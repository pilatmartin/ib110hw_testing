This library was created for the course **IB110 - Introduction to Informatics** at [MUNI FI](https://www.fi.muni.cz/).

# Setup
The library can be installed using `pip` like so:
```pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple ib110hw_testing```

It needs to be installed this way due to the fact that it is located on the [testing instance of PyPI](https://test.pypi.org/project/ib110hw-testing/) and the needed dependencies are located on the [main instance of PyPI](https://pypi.org/).

# Modules
## Testing
The module `testing` contains some predefined strategies which can be used with the `hypothesis` library. 

## Transformation
The module `transformation` contains some implementations of some algorithms which can be used to transform automata.
